Description: Computation of approximate potentials for both gradient and non 
    gradient fields. It is known from physics that only gradient fields, also 
    known as conservative, have a well defined potential function. Here we
    present an algorithm, based on the classical Helmholtz decomposition, to 
    obtain an approximate potential function for non gradient fields.
